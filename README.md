- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cujack1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading, writing, coding, playing music, going for hikes, cooking, spending time with friends, and learning new things, especially sciencey stuff, math, philosophy, history, astronomy, cosmology, anything interesting!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript & Computer Science (sorta). I've already worked through HTML & CSS and I've been on JavaScript for 2 months now. I like it a lot; I'm constantly learning new things, including how to spot my own mistakes. The CS textbook I'm reading through is really helping me understand computers on a level I've never even glimpsed! Totally love having my mind blown by a textbook. ha It's mostly just for fun/immersion. I just want to develop an understanding and open my eyes to what's out there!
