- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cujack1
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, writing, coding, playing music, going for hikes, cooking, spending time with friends, and learning new things, especially sciencey stuff, math, philosophy, history, astronomy, cosmology, anything interesting!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript & Computer Science (sorta). I've already worked through HTML & CSS and I've been on JavaScript for 2 months now. I like it a lot; I'm constantly learning new things, including how to spot my own mistakes. The CS textbook I'm reading through is really helping me understand computers on a level I've never even glimpsed! Totally love having my mind blown by a textbook. ha It's mostly just for fun/immersion. I just want to develop an understanding and open my eyes to what's out there!
- 🌱👀👋 I'm looking to work on a team coding/programming. I am making the full effort to find work building, maintaining, optimizing, and exploring code. I'm super open to coding together, working on anything, and just being a part of a team in general.
